// Does a block RAM read back what was put in it?
//
// The VM design says no, somewhere, in the open flow: its heap holds the right
// bytes (the bitstream's contents are proved equal to synthesis's) and every
// cell proves equivalent, yet the program reads wrong pointers out of it.  A
// design with a VM, an Ethernet stack and a netboot loader in it cannot say
// which memory shape is at fault, and each experiment costs a 20-minute build.
//
// So: one memory shape per instance, filled with a pattern that makes bit and
// address order visible, read back and compared against the same pattern
// recomputed in logic.  Every shape reports one bit -- did every word match --
// and the UART prints the lot.  What is deliberately included:
//
//   - WIDTHS: 1, 2, 4, 9, 18 and 36 bits, which is where the x1 bug lived and
//     where x2 and x4 have never been tested.
//   - PORTS: read through port B while writing through port A, the shape every
//     memory in the VM has and the one whose width markers nextpnr omits when
//     a port is unused.
//   - ROM: initialised contents never written at run time, read through B --
//     the shape of the VM's code and constant memories.
//
// Build it with Vivado and with the open flow and compare: a shape that fails
// in one and passes in the other is a toolchain bug, named.
